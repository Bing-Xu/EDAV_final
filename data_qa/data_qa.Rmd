### Missing Data Analysis
state_name and Population are missing together due to the extra states added to the prison data (60 State prison total,
70 US prison total (state+federal), 99 Federal BOP), which are not in the population table. REGION are missing for 2014-2016 NE from the original data.

PVINCLM and PVINCLF are missing together for one record.
The question about:
"On December 31, the inmates under your jurisdiction were housed in a privately-operated correctional facility -- Exclude inmates housed in any publicly-operated facility, even if under contract. Include inmates housed in any
privately-operated halfway houses, treatment facilities, hospitals, or other special facilities.
Q: Are these inmates included in the total number of inmates under your jurisdiction?"
are missing for both male and female in 2016 Arkansas (AR) survey.

LFM and LFF are missing together for one record.
The question about:
"On December 31, how many inmates under your jurisdiction were housed in local facilities operated by a county or other local authority? Exclude inmates housed in privately-operated facilities. Include inmates housed in local facilities under
contract or other arrangement."
are missing for both male and female in 2016 Oregon (OR) survey.

#### Investigating on Different Missing Types
Value Label
-9 (M) Data are missing because the state did not respond to the item
-8 (M) Data are missing because the item was not applicable to the state
-2 (M) Item was asked, but only in the aggregate prison population, not by male or female
-1 (M) Item not asked in survey for this year

*custody_jurisdiction_inmates_stats*
The columns that have the most missing rows due to no response from state in are LFCRINCM and LFCRINCF (the number of State inmates housed in local facilities solely to ease crowding for both male and female).
Then the LFCROWDF and LFCROWDM (variables to answer How many inmates were housed in local facilities operated by a county or other local authority that is solely to ease prison crowding?) have the most missing rows.
And then the FACROWDF and FACROWDM (number of inmates who were housed in another State or in a Federal prison because there was no room for them in state correctional facilities.) comes the next. 

This concludes that the state most have no respond regarding crowding issues. And answers for females are less populated for such questions than 
that of males.

Custody versus jurisdiction
Between 1926 and 1976, the official measure of the prison population was the number of inmates in the custody of state or federal correctional officials. State and federal reporting officials were instructed to count all prisoners physically housed under their authority, regardless of whether they or some other entity had legal authority over the inmates.
As states and the Federal Bureau of Prisons increased their use of local jails and interstate compacts to house inmates, NPS began asking states to report a count of inmates under the jurisdiction or legal authority of state and federal adult correctional officials in addition to their custody counts.
Since 1977, the jurisdiction count has been the preferred measure. This count includes all state and federal inmates held in a public or private prison (custody) and those held in jail facilities either physically located inside or outside of the state of legal responsibility, and other inmates who may be temporarily out to court or in transit from the jurisdiction of legal authority to the custody of a confinement facility outside that jurisdiction.
The difference between the total custody count and the jurisdiction count was small (approximately 7,000) when both were first collected in 1977. As more states began to report jurisdiction counts and more states began to rely on local and privately operated facilities to house inmates, the difference increased. At yearend 2016 the jurisdiction population totaled 1,506,800 while the custody population totaled 1,293,887.
