Introduction

It is oft-mentioned that the United States has the highest per-capita incarceration rate in the developed world.  Politicians across the political spectrum attribute this fact to various factors, causing wide-spread confusion.  Furthermore, there are two major crime bills of the past 40 years, introduced in 1984 (during the Reagan administration) and 1994 (during the Clinton administration).  In this project, we seek to investigate trends in the prison population over the past few decades and draw some conclusions about various potential drivers.  For example, was there a particularly sharp change in the overall population after the implementation of one of these bills?  How has the racial and gender breakdown of the prison population changed over time?  Have certain states contributed more to the increase than others?  With consideration of these questions, we hope to gain a more sophisticated understanding of the recent history of the US prison population.
