Data Sources

We initially had three unrelated potential project ideas worth investigating, and split them up amongst the three of us to investigate data availability.  Jamie was in charge of seeking data for a potential project on the US prison system.  At first, he looked in the Bureau of Prisons, which required lots of phone calls to no avail.  He was eventually directed to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, where he was able to find a large time series dataset.  This was a thorough enough dataset that we chose to commit to this project idea, and it served as the primary data source for the project going forward.

The dataset is presented in an untidy format; there is a column for year (1976 - 2016), a column for state, and about two hundred more columns with numeric values.  In total, there are 2106 rows and 210 columns.  These other columns represent lots of different potentially interesting slices of the prison population.  For example, there are columns for each type of prison, each type of custody, every combination of sex and race, a few sentence types, etc.

One issue with the data are missing values.  For example, we hoped to investigate private prisons, but there was a lack of reporting of these data, causing us to not be able to do much meaningful analysis on these populations.  Another issue was lack of total population.  We sought to standardize the incarceration rates over time to the population, so we needed to seek other means to obtaining these data.  A final issue is the lack of tidiness, which took a toll on efficiency and organization of the data.
